The project is a port for reading the binary format used by JPL for data storage ephemeris fully written in java and multithread safe.

Tests were performed using the Linux file de431 architecture that can be downloaded in [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/Linux/](ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/Linux/)
At the moment the project supports only binary format generated for Linux

Questions about other file formats can be read here [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/README.txt](ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/README.txt)

The port was based on the Pluto Project
